<H1>NAME</H1>
<P>
ftpsync - synchronizes a directory with an FTP host efficiently.
</P>
<H1>SYNOPSIS</H1>
<P>
**ftpsync** -h
</P>
<P>
**ftpsync** [-q] [-s]
</P>
<H1>DESCRIPTION</H1>
<P>
**ftpsync** is a program that synchronizes all files beneath the current
directory with an FTP host efficiently.
</P>
<P>
The destination host is identified by a <I>.ftp_upstream</I> in the current
directory that must have the following line:
</P>
<PRE>
  ftp://user@host/path
</PRE>
<P>
The password is found by looking at <I>~/.netrc</I>, see **netrc**(5).
If netrc is unavailable, then gnome-keyring is used. For more information
about gnome-keyring, please refer to <A HREF="http://wiki.github.com/xrogaan/ftpsync/">http://wiki.github.com/xrogaan/ftpsync/</A>.
</P>
<P>
ftpsync sends all files in the current directory to the target host, and stores
the MD5 of the sent files in a <I>hashes.txt</I> files in the remote host. When
syncing again, it checks the MD5 of each file against the one stored in the
remote <I>hashes.txt</I> file, and only sends the files that are different. This
makes ftpsync very efficient when synchronizing a directory with only a few
different files, as long as they are always sent by ftpsync.
